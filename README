ULTIMATE PRO FIGHTER TURBO II
=============================

This will eventually become an awesome and completely unbalanced fighting game.
We're early in the development so don't expect anything.

How to play
-----------

You can't right now, check back later.

How to build
------------

*** UNIX-like

If you check out the VCS directly, you need Autotools (automake, autoconf *with* autoconf archive, etc).
If you use a packaged source release, you don't.

Requirements:
* SDL2
* ImageMagick
* A C++11 compliant compiler

Run:
$ autoreconf -i   # only for a VCS clone, requires Autotools
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install    # or sudo make install

*** Windows

UPFTII uses only portable libraries so it should be possible, but I can't help you.

Roadmap
-------

* 0.1: Simple scene with two facing blobs, fixed camera
* 0.2: Adds input for moving one blob
* 0.3: Adds controller support
* 0.4: Adds two controllers support
* 0.5: Adds simple moves with a 4 keys scheme
* 0.6: Adds basic hit detection
* 0.7: Adds animation support
* 0.8: Adds sound effects support
* 0.9: Adds music support
* 0.10: Adds abstractions for moves (e.g. dashes, directed moves, combos)
* 0.11: Adds life bars and win
* 0.12: Adds BG support
* 0.13: Adds hit feedback
* 1.0: Sample fighters, sound effects, music and stage to make a playable (if somewhat limited) game
* 1.x: Stuff we forgot but are needed to consider it a game
* 2.0: Adds menus and customization (import custom fighters and stages)
* 2.x: Iterations of the fighters/stage format and advanced fighting game stuff (e.g. damage reduction, combos limiters, scrolling camera and/or wall slam)
* 3.0: Decentralized network support (for fighting and sharing stuff)

If we actually reach that, a built-in editor (rather than a spec) would be a must.

No version with centralized network is planned. If the decentralization proves too difficult, the fighting will be implemented via direct connection and the sharing via sending emails to your friends.
