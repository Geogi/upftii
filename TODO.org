* Roadmap

New item on roadmap is 0.3: controller support.

* Other

** Customizable fighter speed > 1

Allows to increase the delay (better for the CPU).

** Preload textures

Currently we rebuild the textures from the PNGs each time they're
modified.  It's inefficient (whatever overhead MagickWand may add,
it's fine as long as it's during init; now it's while playing) and
probably introduces a mem leak (I'm not sure what happens with the
previous SDL_Textures).
